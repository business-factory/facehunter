<h1>Face Hunter</h1>
<h4>powered by <a href="https://www.roihunter.com/join-us">ROI Hunter</a></h4>
This is an open-source Slack face guessing game. Let's be honest: it was written solely for the purpose of improving ROI Hunter brand awareness. It is based on a previous game that was developed by our Internal team in their spare time, but then got pretty popular.

<h3>Installation</h3>
Simply install the app from Slack app directory.

<h3>Running the app</h3>
Use `/facehunt` slash command in any public channel. Facehunter will register this and will send a PM to you. Nothing else needed.

<h3>Limitations</h3>
While the app works pretty well, if I do say so myself, there are a few limitations posed by Slack.

Unfortunately Slack doesn't tell males and females apart, which leads to female names being shown for male users and vice versa.

The app requires at least 5 active users in your workspace to work, as it would make little sense otherwise.

Only people who have uploaded their profile image can be shown. You wouldn't be able to guess them without their photos anyway.

The app is limited to only one Slack workspace. While we are aware there are some (particularly larger) companies that keep multiple Slack workspaces for different teams, Face Hunter (at least at this moment) doesn't support that.
