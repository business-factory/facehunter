This file lists all data we store about the users of Face Hunter.

<h3>Stored in database</h3>
We don't store any personal data. Our database records store only the following:
<ul>
<li>team name</li>
<li>team id</li>
<li>access token</li>
<li>bot id</li>
<li>bot token</li>
</ul>

While none of these stored data are in any way personal, please be aware that we still adhere to the best security practices.

<h3>Logs</h3>
Simple: there are no logs. As company we of course use logging in our apps, but in this case we decided to omit the logs and only use Kubernetes logs for errors.
